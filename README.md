Environmental Data Analysis Tool

*Need detailed description here*


For Us, The Developers:
Okay, so far I've gotten it to connect to my locally hosted server (which uses XAMPP). I have also gotten my old user and passsword sanitisation method to work successfully.
For your use all you will need to modify are:
	- db_conn

That's it. So long as you use one that matches your conditions, you'll be fine. Eventually we'll make it the db of Scott and his team, but for testing i'd recommend making your own. 
If you need assistance with this contact me.
Thanks all!

- Blake
